# Deployment

## Vercel Configuration
- Project uses Vercel for deployment
- Deploy scripts are defined in package.json
- Production deploy: `npm run deploy` or `pnpm deploy`
- Preview deploy: `npm run test-deploy` or `pnpm test-deploy`
- Vercel CLI is installed as a dev dependency

## Deployment Process
- First deployment requires Vercel account login
- CLI guides through project linking and configuration
- Subsequent deployments use saved configuration
- GitHub integration can be set up for automatic deployments on push

## Environment Variables
- Sensitive information should be set in Vercel dashboard
- Environment variables should not be committed to the repository
- Use `.env.local` for local development only

## Build Optimization
- Next.js builds are optimized by default
- Vercel automatically handles Next.js optimizations
- Large assets should be stored in the `public` directory
- Preload critical assets for better performance

## Troubleshooting
- Check build logs in Vercel dashboard for errors
- Verify environment variables are correctly set
- Test local build with `npm run build` before deploying
- Use preview deployments to test changes before going to production
